**Recommendations (optional):** 
Security Implementation Plan for Botium Toys

The objective of this plan is to ensure the security of sensitive data, comply with regulatory standards (PCI DSS, GDPR, SOC1, and SOC2), and create a safer environment for employees and customers.
To achieve this, a least privilege policy with role separation will be implemented, clearly defining which data will be available, who can access it, and for how long. This approach reduces the risk of unauthorized access and enhances organizational security.
Additionally, access control and account management policies will be established. Each employee will have limited access to the information necessary for their role, with permissions configured granularly. Accounts will be managed throughout their lifecycle, and regular reviews will ensure unnecessary access is revoked.
Sensitive data, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Sensitive Personal Information (SPII), will be encrypted both in transit and at rest. Credit card transactions will also be protected with robust encryption, and the network where this data is transmitted will be secured with protocols such as TLS/SSL.
To comply with GDPR, a data classification and inventory process will be implemented, categorizing data based on sensitivity levels and maintaining updated records. This measure ensures that data is available only to authorized individuals and is securely managed.
A stricter password policy will be adopted, requiring a minimum of 12 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and the use of MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication). Passwords will need to be updated periodically, and a centralized password management system will be implemented to strengthen security. Additionally, a secure password recovery system will be provided.
An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) will also be installed to identify and respond to suspicious network activities. The IDS will be configured to issue immediate alerts, enabling the IT team to respond quickly to potential threats.
Lastly, legacy systems will be regularly monitored with defined maintenance and intervention routines to address vulnerabilities and failures. These systems will be integrated into the overall security plan to ensure continuous protection.
By implementing these measures, Botium Toys will comply with the standards of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and SOC1 and SOC2 frameworks. This will strengthen the company’s data protection, mitigate risks, and create a safe and trustworthy environment for employees and customers.
